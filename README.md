# Udemy-Python-Bootcamp

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Enrolled for Angela Yu's 100 day Python Bootcamp from a year back..ðŸ˜…
So it occurred to me, why not share all those codes on github.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The bootcamp consists of 100 days, where each day is covered with different coding challenges, by the end of the course I think one can develop pretty confidence in coding in Python. 
I took up the course to get a hands-on on the variety of different projects, some of the projects are still pending. 
I hope to complete each one of them by the end of this year, hopefully. ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž
